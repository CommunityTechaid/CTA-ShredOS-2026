# CTA ShredOS 2026

Rather than try and merge the changes from upstream in the ShredOS fork, the idea is to take what works and build it using the latest Buildroot release.

## Steps

- Grab Buildroot
- Dump any superfluous `./boards/` and `./configs` for clarity
- Copy `./board/shredos/*` and `./configs/shredos_defconfig`
- Copy `./package/kernel_cmdline_extractor`
- Add `kernel_cmdline_extractor` to package config
- Copy `./package/nwipe`
- Add `nwipe` to package config
- Edit configs to remove depricated options (eg., directfb and libhid)
- Build
- Proceed as normal.

## ToDo
- Check kernel config in `./boards/shredos` for legacy options 
- Test removing ext2 root fs as only `bzImage` is used to generate .img
- Test removing tar root fs as only `bzImage` is used to generate .img
- Diff upstream's shredos_defconfig & kernel configs against ours to check differences are sane.

## How to use
These instructions are in addition to the official [ShredOS repo](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64)
- Build the image as per the upstream documentation. (TL;DR: -`make distclean; make shredos_defconfig; make`)
- Mount image so it's available for the PXE boot setup.
- Create a directory to store the [CTA Hardward Info](https://github.com/CommunityTechaid/HardwardInfo) scripts on the server.
	(eg `mkdir /srv/netboot/shredos/HardwardInfoScripts`)
- Copy / clone scripts into the folder
	(`git clone https://github.com/CommunityTechaid/HardwardInfo /srv/netboot/shredos/HardwardInfoScripts`)
- Add kernal parameters to the `menu.ipxe` file (Or `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and `/EFI/grub/grub.cfg` if not using the PXE setup)
	- Get the scripts
		- `get_scripts="open 10.0.0.1; user ServerUser Password; cd path/To/HardwardInfo/Scripts; mget -O /usr/bin/scripts ./*sh; exit`
  		- The custom scripts directory on the server should hold all the scripts that need to be executed before or after nwipe. The scripts should be named as follows. 
			- `pre_00X[scriptname].sh` for all scripts that need to be run *before* nwipe is launched. `00X` is a number used to denote precedence.  Lower numbered scripts are executed first. 
			- `post_00X[scriptname].sh` for all scripts that need to be run *after* nwipe is launched.- 
	- Nwipe_logs param (old setup using the .txt logs)
   		- `lftp="open 10.0.0.1; user ServerUser Password; cd shredos; mput nwipe_*.txt; exit`
     	- JSON device logs
      		- `lftp="open 10.0.0.1; user ServerUser Password; cd shredos; mput device*.json; exit`

- Note: Make sure the custom scripts are tested. If one script fails. the execution of the remaining scripts are abandoned. Some logs will be available in scripts.log but on the filesystem. 

## Changes in the custom build

### Changes to `nwipe_launcher`
The nwipe\_launcher (`board/shredos/fsoverlay/usr/bin/nwipe_launcher.sh`) is the main script that is launched in the terminal that is responsible for launching nwipe. The following changes were introduced to the script. 

- Hooks to run execute custom scripts before and after nwipe executes was introduced. `nwipe_launcher.sh` gets the lftp command that was passed through the `get_scripts` parameter that can be configured in grub.cfg (check ShredOS documentation for more instructions on grub.cfg). This parameter expects an `lftp` command to grab custom scripts from the local ftp server and place them in a scripts directory (`/urs/bin/scripts/`). All scripts named `pre_*.sh` will be executed before nwipe is launched and all scripts named `post_*.sh` will be executed after nwipe completes. 
- `nwipe_launcher` also creates an output folder (`/usr/output/`) which can be used to store the results of any custom scripts that are executed. These results can be then transferred to a local ftp server using another lftp command that should be configured in grub.cfg the same way as above. Refer [GitHub - ShredOs documentation](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64?tab=readme-ov-file#transferring-nwipe-log-files-to-a-ftp-server)
- A confirmation was added before nwipe is launched. If you answer N (anything but Y technically), nwipe will not be run. **Note that post_*.sh scripts will still be executed.**

The following new scripts were also added: 
(all scripts are in `board/shredos/fsoverlay/usr/bin/`)
- `pre.sh` : Executes all the `pre_*.sh` scripts inside `/usr/bin/scripts/`. Executed by `nwipe_launcher`
- `post.sh` Executes all the `post_*.sh` scripts inside `/usr/bin/scripts/`Executed by `nwipe_launcher`
These will be executed only if the `get_scripts` argument is found.

### New packages

The following packages are part of this build (configured using buildroot):
- `dialog`
- `jq`
- `lshw`
- `lsblk`

If starting from scratch, after running `make shredos_defconfig`, run `make menuconfig` to ensure that they are added.

Add them via the Target packages menu:
	> Shell and utilities > dialog
	> Development tools > jq
	> Hardware handling > lshw

(Optional: Build Options > Enable compiler cache - This option will enable the use of ccache, a compiler cache. It will cache the result of previous builds to speed up builds.)

Save the config, exit and run `make` to build the image.

## Testing

If built on Theta (or any system with `qemu` set up), run the following to launch a test machine:
```bash
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -m 4096 \
    -kernel ./output/images/bzImage \
    -append 'console=tty3 \
    		 loglevel=3 \
    		 loadkeys=uk \
    		 nwipe_options="--method=zero --verify=last --noblank --nousb --nowait --autonuke" \
    		 get_scripts="open 10.0.0.1; user netboot-log ThreeInOne!; cd scripts; mget -O /usr/bin/scripts ./*sh; exit" \
    		 lftp_user="$UserName" \
    		 lftp_pass="$Password" \
    		 lftp="open 10.0.0.1; user $UserName $Password; cd shredos; mput nwipe_*.txt; mput /usr/output/*.json; exit"'
```
